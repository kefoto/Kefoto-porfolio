Despite this is called porfolio, this is my first attempt deployed landing page about myself. 

In the beginning of 2024, I set myself a goal that I want to make my own website for my skills and hobby (photography) without using WIX or SquareSpace (I did not want to pay for those services).

Hence, I picked up front-end dev during winter break by going through Neetcode lessons. 

Certainly, there are a lot of mistakes I made during the first half of the 2024. There are a lot of improvements needed to make. 

I realized rendering all elements all at once is fundamentally flawed, and I shifted to learning React and buliding web applications. Through the process of learning that, I noticed so many mistakes I made in pure web dev pipeline.

One example, I kept adding mouselisten hooks to one of the conditionally rendered sections when I open it (No wonder the website is going to get laggier and laggier!!!)
